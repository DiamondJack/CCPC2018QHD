{{ s('description') }}

Niuniu has a clock with two hands, an hour hand and a minute hand. Sometimes it looks like just having one hand because the two hands coincide. Niuniu wants to know how many times the two hands coincide from A'o clock to B'o clock ($0\le A < B \le 24$). (If the two hands coincide at A'o clock, it will be counted. But coincidence will not be counted at B'o clock.)

The first line contains an integer T ($0\le T \le 300$) which is the number of cases.

The next T lines give two integers A and B for each case.

{{ s('output format') }}

{{ self.output_file() }}

Output T lines, each line containing an integer as the answer of each case.
